## README for FashionMNIST GAN Modifications

### Overview

This project adapts an existing GAN model originally designed for the MNIST dataset to generate images from the FashionMNIST dataset. FashionMNIST consists of grayscale images of fashion items, unlike the handwritten digits of MNIST. This adaptation involves modifying several parts of the code to handle the different characteristics of the FashionMNIST dataset, which is essential to accurately generate fashion item images that are representative of the actual dataset.

### Specific Code Changes

1. **Dataset Change:**
   - **Original Code:** The dataset was MNIST, typically containing grayscale images of handwritten digits.
   - **Modified Code:** The dataset was changed to FashionMNIST, which contains grayscale images of various fashion items.

2. **Output Channels Modification in GenerativeNet:**
   - **Original Code:**
     ```python
     nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=128, out_channels=3, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1, bias=False)
     ```
   - **Modified Code:**
     ```python
     nn.ConvTranspose2d(in_channels=128, out_channels=1, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1, bias=False)
     ```

3. **Input Channels Modification in DiscriminativeNet:**
   - **Original Code:**
     ```python
     nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, out_channels=128, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1, bias=False)
     ```
   - **Modified Code:**
     ```python
     nn.Conv2d(in_channels=1, out_channels=128, kernel_size=4, stride=2, padding=1, bias=False)
     ```

4. **Number of Test Samples Increase:**
   - **Original Code:**
     ```python
     num_test_samples = 16
     test_noise = noise(num_test_samples)
     ```
   - **Modified Code:**
     ```python
     num_test_samples = 32
     test_noise = noise(num_test_samples)
     ```

### Impact of Modifications

- **Dataset Change:** Utilizing FashionMNIST instead of MNIST allows the GAN to operate on a different domain of images, testing its ability to generalize and produce fashion-related images. This requires adjustments in model architecture specifically tailored to the type and complexity of images in FashionMNIST.

- **Output and Input Channels Modification:** Since FashionMNIST images are grayscale, changing the number of input and output channels in the neural networks is crucial. This ensures that the networks are architecturally compatible with the format of the data, potentially impacting the training dynamics and quality of the generated images.

- **Increase in Test Samples:** By increasing the number of test samples, we enhance the robustness of the model evaluation. This gives a better understanding of the model's performance across a broader set of data, offering insights into its consistency and reliability in generating diverse fashion items.

The above modifications are essential for adapting a GAN model from generating MNIST images to FashionMNIST images, impacting the model's ability to learn and generate high-quality images that faithfully represent the distribution of the FashionMNIST dataset.
